# Cucumber-Integration

Cucumber is a testing framework which supports Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). It lets us define application behaviour in plain meaningful English text using a simple grammar defined by a language called Gherkin. Cucumber itself is written inRuby, but it can be used to “test” code written in Ruby or other languages including but not limited to Java, C# and Python.
